# Rust LeetCode Solutions 

My solutions for LeetCode problems in Rust. The original problem fetching and testing framework came from https://github.com/aylei/leetcode-rust and evolves different features from https://github.com/mapx/leetcode-rust. 

* Run `cargo run`, then provide an id to initialize the template submission file of "problem #id".
* Run `cargo test n{id}` to test the solution for "problem #id".
* Run `cargo test` to test all solutions.
